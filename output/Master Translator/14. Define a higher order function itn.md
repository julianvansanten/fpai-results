A question is asked by a student: "Define a higher order function `itn` (for “iterate `n` times”) with three arguments `f`, `a`, `n` in Haskell."
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

Certainly, let's break down the higher-order function `itn` in Haskell.

1. **Function Name**: `itn` is the name of our function. 

2. **Arguments**: 
   - `f`: This is a function itself. Since Haskell is a functional language, you can pass functions as arguments.
   - `a`: This is the initial argument on which `f` will be applied.
   - `n`: This is an integer representing how many times `f` should be applied to `a`.

3. **Functionality**: 
   - The idea is that `itn` will apply `f` to `a`, `n` times. For instance, if `f` is a function that adds 2, `a` is 0, and `n` is 3, then the output will be 6 (0 + 2 + 2 + 2).

4. **Higher Order Aspect**: 
   - This function is considered a higher-order function because it takes another function (`f`) as an input.

5. **Recursion in Haskell**: 
   - To implement this, you typically use recursion. You'd check if `n` is 0, in which case you return `a` because no further applications of `f` are needed. If `n` is greater than 0, you recursively call `itn` with `f`, `f a` (which applies `f` to `a`), and `n-1` (reducing the count).

6. **Type Signature**: 
   - In Haskell, it's good practice to define a type signature for your functions. For `itn`, the type signature will depend on the type of `f` and `a`. If `f` is a function that takes an `Int` and returns an `Int`, and `a` is an `Int`, then the type signature would be something like `itn :: (Int -> Int) -> Int -> Int -> Int`.

Remember, the key in functional programming, especially in Haskell, is to think in terms of functions and their compositions. `itn` is a good example of how higher-order functions can be used to create powerful abstractions.
