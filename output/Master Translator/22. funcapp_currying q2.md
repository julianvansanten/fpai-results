A question is asked by a student: "A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
How do I fix this?"
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

The error you're encountering is due to the way you are calling the function `f` with a single argument, which is a tuple `(1, 2)`. In Haskell, functions are curried by default, meaning they take their arguments one at a time. 

Your function `f` is defined to take two arguments, `x` and `y`, separately. When you call `f (1, 2)`, Haskell interprets this as you passing a single argument, which is a tuple `(1, 2)`, to the function `f`. However, the function `f` is expecting two individual arguments, not a tuple.

To fix this error, you need to call the function with two separate arguments, like `f 1 2`. This way, you're passing `1` as the first argument and `2` as the second argument, which matches the function's definition. 

Remember, in Haskell, when you see a function application like `f a b`, it means `f` is applied to `a` first, resulting in a function that is then applied to `b`. This is different from languages where functions are typically called with all arguments enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
