A question is asked by a student: "I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
Why am I not able to use the `<` operator?"
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

The error message `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’` indicates that Haskell's type system is unable to confirm that the elements in the list can be ordered, which is necessary for the `<` operation. 

In Haskell, types like `Int`, `Float`, `Char`, etc., are instances of the `Ord` type class, which is required for ordering comparisons like `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. Your function signature `incr :: [a] -> Bool` uses a type variable `a` to indicate that it can take a list of any type. However, not all types can be ordered. For example, how would you compare two functions or two IO actions?

To resolve this, you need to specify that the elements of the list must be of a type that supports ordering. This is done by constraining the type variable `a` to be an instance of the `Ord` type class. You can modify the function's type signature to reflect this constraint. 

Here's how you can think about it: You're telling Haskell, "This function works for any type `a`, as long as `a` is a type that can be ordered." This way, Haskell knows it can use the `<` operator on elements of the list.

Remember, this approach is commonly used in Haskell when you need to ensure that the types you work with support certain operations or behaviors, as defined by type classes like `Ord`, `Eq`, `Show`, etc.
