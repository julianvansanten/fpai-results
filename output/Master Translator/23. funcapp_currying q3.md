A question is asked by a student: "A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
How do I use the function `f` with `(1, 2)`?"
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

The error message you're encountering in Haskell indicates that the function `f` is being applied to a single argument, which is a tuple `(1, 2)`, rather than two separate arguments. In Haskell, functions are curried by default, which means they take one argument at a time. When you define `f x y = x + y`, Haskell interprets it as a function that takes an argument `x`, and then returns a function that takes another argument `y`.

To use the function `f` with the values `1` and `2`, you need to apply them as two separate arguments, not as a single tuple. You do this by calling the function with each argument separately, like `f 1 2`. This way, Haskell understands that you are passing two arguments to the function `f`, first `1` and then `2`, and it can then perform the addition as defined in the function.

Remember, when you see an error message about an instance for `Show` for a function type, it often means Haskell is interpreting your input as a function rather than a value, which usually hints at a mismatch in the number of arguments you're supplying to a function.
