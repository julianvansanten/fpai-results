A question is asked by a student: "I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

How can I fix this?"

It looks like you're on the right track with your Haskell functions, but there are a few adjustments needed to align the types and functionality correctly. Let's break down the issues and how you can address them without directly providing code:

1. **Issue with `divisers` Function:**
   - Your `divisers` function is intended to find all divisors of a given number. However, there's a small mistake in the list comprehension. You're using `m `mod` n == 0`, but it should be `n `mod` m == 0` to find divisors of `n`.

2. **Type Mismatch in `isPrime` Function:**
   - The error message indicates a type mismatch. Your `isPrime` function is declared to return an `Int` but actually returns a `Bool` since the expression `divisers n == [1, n]` evaluates to a Boolean value. To fix this, you need to change the type signature of `isPrime` from `Int -> Int` to `Int -> Bool`.

3. **Modification in `primes` Function:**
   - Once you correct the type of `isPrime`, the `primes` function needs to use a filtering mechanism instead of `map`. `map` is used for transforming each element in a list, but here you want to filter out non-prime numbers. Therefore, you should use a function like `filter` which keeps only those elements in the list that satisfy the `isPrime` predicate.

Remember, in Haskell, ensuring that function signatures correctly match their implementations is crucial. The type system is there to help you write correct programs, so it's always a good idea to think about what type each part of your function should be. This approach will greatly help in debugging and writing functions that work as intended.
