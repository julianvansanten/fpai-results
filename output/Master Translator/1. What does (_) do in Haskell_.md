A question is asked by a student: "What does `(:)` do in Haskell?"
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

In Haskell, the `(:)` operator is known as the "cons" operator. It's used to prepend an element to the front of a list. When you see `(:)`, it's essentially a function that takes two arguments: an element and a list. The result of applying this function is a new list with the element added at the beginning.

To provide a conceptual understanding without using code, imagine you have a train and you want to add a new carriage at the front. The `(:)` operator is like the action of attaching this new carriage to the front of the train. Each carriage can be thought of as an element, and the train as the list. So, when you use `(:)`, you're essentially adding a new carriage to the start of your train, thereby extending it. This analogy helps understand how `(:)` works in building lists in Haskell.
