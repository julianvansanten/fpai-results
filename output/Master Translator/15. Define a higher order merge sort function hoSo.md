A question is asked by a student: "Define a higher order merge sort function hoSort in Haskell, in which the relation by which a list should be sorted is given as an argument `r`."
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

Certainly! When defining a higher-order `mergeSort` function in Haskell, the key is to understand that the function will accept another function as an argument. This argument, which we can call `r`, will be a relation (or a comparison function) used to determine the order of sorting.

Here's how the teacher might guide the student without providing the actual code:

1. **Function Signature**: Start by defining the function signature of `hoSort`. It will take two arguments: the comparison function `r` and the list to be sorted. The comparison function `r` will have a signature like `(a -> a -> Bool)`, where `a` is the type of the elements in the list. The `hoSort` function itself will be of type `(a -> a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]`.

2. **Defining Merge Function**: Create a `merge` function that uses the comparison function `r` to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list. This function should compare elements from each list using `r` and arrange them accordingly.

3. **Implementing Merge Sort**: The merge sort algorithm generally involves splitting the list into two halves, recursively sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves. In this implementation, ensure that the recursive calls to sort the halves use the comparison function `r`.

4. **Base Case**: Remember to define the base case for the recursion. In the case of merge sort, the base case is usually when the list is empty or has a single element, in which case it is already sorted.

5. **Combining Everything**: Combine these components to define `hoSort`. The function will split the list, recursively call itself on the halves, and then use the `merge` function to combine the sorted halves.

6. **Testing**: Finally, it's important to test the `hoSort` function with different comparison functions (like less than, greater than, etc.) and different types of lists to ensure it works as expected.

By guiding the student through these steps, the teacher helps them understand not just how to write the function, but also the concepts behind higher-order functions and the merge sort algorithm in functional programming.
