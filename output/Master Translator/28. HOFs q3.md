A question is asked by a student: "I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

How else can I define `primes`?"

It appears you're encountering type mismatch errors in your Haskell code due to conflicting type expectations between the functions you've defined. Let's break down the issues and how you can resolve them:

1. **`isPrime` Function Issue**:
   - Your original `isPrime` function returns a `Bool` (True or False), but its type signature is declared as `Int -> Int`. This causes the first error.
   - To fix this, you should change the type signature of `isPrime` to `Int -> Bool`. This accurately reflects that `isPrime` determines whether an integer is prime (True) or not (False).

2. **`divisers` Function Issue**:
   - There's a minor typo in your `divisers` function. It should be `n `mod` m == 0` instead of `m `mod` n == 0`.
   - This function should return all divisors of `n`, but with `m `mod` n == 0`, it checks if `n` is a divisor of `m`, which is not the intention.

3. **`primes` Function Issue**:
   - After correcting `isPrime`, its type will be `Int -> Bool`. But `primes` is expected to take a list of integers and return a list of integers, not Booleans.
   - To fix this, instead of using `map`, you should use `filter`. `filter` applies a predicate (in this case, `isPrime`) to a list and returns a list of elements for which the predicate is True.

4. **Refined Approach**:
   - Revise `isPrime` to have the type `Int -> Bool`.
   - Correct the logic in `divisers` to properly identify divisors.
   - Redefine `primes` to use `filter isPrime` instead of `map isPrime`.

By making these adjustments, your Haskell functions should align correctly with their intended purposes, and the `primes` function will effectively return a list of prime numbers from a given list of integers. Remember, the key is to ensure the types and logic in each function are consistent with their intended roles in the program.
