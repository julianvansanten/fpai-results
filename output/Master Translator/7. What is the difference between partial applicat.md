A question is asked by a student: "What is the difference between partial application and currying?"

Certainly! The concepts of partial application and currying are fundamental in functional programming, and it's important to understand their differences:

1. **Currying**: This is a process in functional programming where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. In currying, when you pass fewer arguments than the function expects, you get back another function that expects the remaining arguments. For example, if you have a function that takes three arguments, currying transforms it into three functions, each taking one argument. When you pass the first argument to the first function, it returns another function that takes the second argument, and so on.

2. **Partial Application**: This is a technique where you take a function and fix a few arguments, resulting in a new function that requires fewer arguments than the original one. It's like creating a new function by filling in some of the arguments of the existing function beforehand. Unlike currying, which always returns unary functions (functions with a single argument), partial application can return functions with multiple arguments if the original function had more arguments than those partially applied.

In summary, currying always breaks down a multi-argument function into a series of unary functions, whereas partial application fixes some of the arguments of the function and returns a new function that takes the remaining arguments. Both concepts are used to simplify the function calling process and to create more specific functions from more general ones.
