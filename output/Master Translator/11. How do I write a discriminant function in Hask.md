A question is asked by a student: "How do I write a discriminant function in Haskell?"
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

To guide the student in writing a discriminant function in Haskell without providing direct code, the teacher could explain the concept and the steps involved in creating such a function. Here's how the teacher might approach it:

1. **Explain the Concept of Discriminant**: The teacher would begin by explaining what a discriminant is. In the context of quadratic equations (ax² + bx + c = 0), the discriminant is given by the formula b² - 4ac. It's used to determine the nature of the roots of the equation.

2. **Introduce Haskell Syntax Basics**: Since this is an introductory course, the teacher would ensure that the student is familiar with basic Haskell syntax, such as how to define functions, how to declare types, and how to perform basic arithmetic operations.

3. **Breaking Down the Task**: The teacher would then break down the task into smaller parts:
   - How to define a function that takes three arguments (a, b, and c).
   - How to perform the calculation b² - 4ac within the function.
   - How to return the result.

4. **Discuss Function Types**: The teacher would discuss the importance of type declarations in Haskell, guiding the student on how to declare the type of the discriminant function. This would include specifying that the function takes three numbers (possibly `Float` or `Double`) and returns a number.

5. **Encourage Experimentation**: The teacher would encourage the student to experiment with writing the function, perhaps starting with a simpler function and then expanding it to calculate the discriminant.

6. **Test Cases**: Suggest creating test cases to check if the function works correctly. For example, the student could test the function with known values of a, b, and c where the discriminant is positive, negative, and zero, and see if the function returns the correct results.

7. **Discuss Error Handling**: Optionally, the teacher might introduce the concept of error handling, such as dealing with cases where the input does not represent a valid quadratic equation (e.g., when a = 0).

8. **Resources for Further Learning**: Finally, the teacher could provide resources for further learning, such as links to Haskell documentation or tutorials that explain similar concepts.

By guiding the student through the process in this manner, the teacher helps them understand not just how to write the function, but also the underlying principles of Haskell programming and the mathematical concept of the discriminant.
