A question is asked by a student: "I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
How do I fix this?"
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

The error message you're encountering, `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`, indicates a type constraint issue. In Haskell, the `<` operator is part of the `Ord` typeclass, which means it can only be used with types that are instances of `Ord`. The type signature of your `incr` function, `incr :: [a] -> Bool`, uses a generic type `a`, but does not specify that `a` must be an instance of `Ord`.

To fix this error, you need to constrain the type `a` to be an instance of `Ord`. You can do this by modifying the type signature of your function to indicate that `a` must belong to the `Ord` typeclass. The corrected type signature would look like this:

```haskell
incr :: (Ord a) => [a] -> Bool
```

With this change, your function specifies that it works for any type `a` that has an ordering, which is required for the `<` operator to function correctly. This should resolve the error you're encountering. Remember, in Haskell, when you use operations like `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=`, the types involved must be instances of the `Ord` typeclass, and this must be reflected in the function's type signature.
