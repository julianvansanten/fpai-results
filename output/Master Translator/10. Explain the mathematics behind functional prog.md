Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. To understand the mathematics behind functional programming, we delve into a few key concepts:

1. **Mathematical Functions**: In mathematics, a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs. Functional programming is based on this concept, where functions are treated as first-class citizens. These functions, like in math, are deterministic, meaning given the same input, they will always produce the same output.

2. **Immutability**: This concept is akin to mathematical constants. Once a value is created, it cannot be altered. This property ensures predictability and consistency in functional programs, similar to how constants behave in mathematical equations.

3. **Function Composition**: This is a fundamental concept in mathematics where the result of one function is applied as the input to another function. In functional programming, composing functions is a common practice, creating a sequence of operations that is easier to reason about and debug.

4. **Higher-Order Functions**: These are functions that can take other functions as inputs and/or return them as outputs. This concept is similar to operators in mathematics that can act on other functions (like differentiation or integration in calculus).

5. **Recursion**: Recursion in functional programming mirrors mathematical induction, where a function calls itself with a simpler or smaller input, and there is a base case to terminate the recursion. This concept is prevalent in functional programming due to the absence of iterative state-changing loops.

6. **Purity and Side-Effects**: A pure function in functional programming is one where the output value is determined only by its input values, without observable side effects. This is similar to how mathematical functions work – a function’s output value is only dependent on its input values.

7. **Lambda Calculus**: This is a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application. It serves as a foundation for functional programming languages, representing functions as first-class citizens.

In conclusion, functional programming mirrors many concepts from mathematics, emphasizing functions, immutability, and the absence of side-effects. These principles lead to more predictable and bug-resistant code, akin to the reliability found in mathematical equations.
