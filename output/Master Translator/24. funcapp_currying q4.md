A question is asked by a student: "A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
Give a function call that works."
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

In Haskell, when you define a function like `f x y = x + y`, it expects two separate arguments, `x` and `y`. The function `f` is defined to take two arguments and add them together.

However, when you call `f (1, 2)`, you are passing a single argument, which is a tuple `(1, 2)`. Haskell interprets this as trying to pass one argument to a function that expects two, leading to the error message you received. The error message is essentially saying that it can't find a way to display the function applied to a tuple, as it's expecting more arguments.

To correctly call the function, you should pass two separate arguments like this: `f 1 2`. This way, you are providing two individual arguments `1` and `2` to the function `f`, which is what it expects.
