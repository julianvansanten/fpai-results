A question is asked by a student: "I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

Generate a function primes which gives all prime numbers out of a given list."

The errors you're encountering in your Haskell code are due to a mismatch in expected and actual types in your functions. Let's go through the issues and how you can resolve them:

1. **Error in `isPrime` Function:**
   The error "Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’" in your `isPrime` function is because the function's type signature is `Int -> Int`, but the function is actually returning a `Bool` value (`divisers n == [1, n]` is a boolean expression).

   To fix this, you should change the type signature of `isPrime` to `Int -> Bool`, as it is meant to check if a number is prime (a true/false question).

2. **Issue in `divisers` Function:**
   There's a small mistake in your `divisers` function. The condition should be `n `mod` m == 0` instead of `m `mod` n == 0`. This function is supposed to return a list of all divisors of `n`.

3. **Error in `primes` Function:**
   After fixing `isPrime`, you'll still encounter the error "Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’" in the `primes` function. This is because `map` is expecting a function that takes an `Int` and returns an `Int`, but `isPrime` returns a `Bool`. 

   Instead, you should use the `filter` function, not `map`. `filter` takes a predicate (a function that returns a `Bool`) and a list, then returns a new list of elements for which the predicate is `True`.

In summary, here's how you should approach fixing your code:

- Update the `isPrime` function's type signature to `Int -> Bool`.
- Correct the logic in `divisers` function to `n `mod` m == 0`.
- Use `filter` instead of `map` in the `primes` function, as you want to filter out non-prime numbers.

This should resolve the issues you're facing and help you create a working `primes` function in Haskell.
