QuickCheck in Haskell is a powerful tool for testing code, designed specifically to support the principles of functional programming. The key concept behind QuickCheck is property-based testing, which differs from example-based testing (like unit tests). Here's an overview of how QuickCheck works without delving into code:

1. **Defining Properties**: In QuickCheck, you define properties that your functions should satisfy. A property is a statement or a condition that should always be true for your function, regardless of the specific inputs. These properties are written as functions themselves.

2. **Automatic Test Case Generation**: Once you have defined a property, QuickCheck automatically generates random test cases (inputs) to test this property. This is a significant shift from traditional testing methods where developers write specific test cases. QuickCheck uses random generation to cover a broad and unexpected range of inputs.

3. **Running Tests**: After generating the test cases, QuickCheck runs the function with these inputs to check if the property holds. If the property holds true for all the generated cases, the test passes.

4. **Shrinking**: One of the unique features of QuickCheck is its ability to 'shrink' a failing test case to a simpler form. If a test fails, QuickCheck tries to simplify the input to the smallest example that still causes the failure. This feature is extremely useful in identifying the root cause of the failure.

5. **Repeatability and Randomness Control**: Although QuickCheck uses random data for testing, it also allows you to control this randomness. You can set a seed for the random number generator, ensuring that tests are repeatable. This is important for debugging and fixing issues.

6. **Custom Generators**: Sometimes, the default random generators might not produce relevant or valid inputs for your function. In such cases, you can define custom generators that produce more appropriate test data for your properties.

7. **Integration with Test Suites**: QuickCheck can be easily integrated with standard Haskell testing frameworks, allowing you to combine property-based tests with other forms of tests like unit tests.

8. **Limitations and Use Cases**: While QuickCheck is powerful, it's important to understand its limitations. It's excellent for testing functions with clear properties and can uncover edge cases that developers might not consider. However, it might not be as effective for testing functions with side effects or in scenarios where defining clear properties is challenging.

In essence, QuickCheck in Haskell automates the process of test case generation and simplification, focusing on the properties that the code should satisfy rather than specific examples or scenarios. This approach can significantly enhance the robustness of your code by uncovering edge cases and ensuring that key properties hold under a wide range of conditions.
