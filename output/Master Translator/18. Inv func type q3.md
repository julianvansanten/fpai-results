A question is asked by a student: "I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
What does `Ord a` mean?"
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

The error message `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’` in Haskell indicates a type class constraint issue. Here's an explanation that should help clarify the problem and how to address it:

1. **Type Classes in Haskell**: In Haskell, a type class is a sort of interface that defines some behavior. If a type is a member of a type class, it means that it supports and implements the behavior described by the type class. Common type classes in Haskell include `Eq` for types that support equality testing, `Num` for numeric types, and `Ord` for types that have an ordering.

2. **The `Ord` Type Class**: Specifically, the `Ord` type class is used for types whose values can be ordered. This class includes methods for comparing values, such as `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. When you use one of these comparison operators, the types of the values being compared must be instances of the `Ord` type class.

3. **Your Function and the Error**: In your `incr` function, you're using the `<` operator to compare elements of a list. This means that the elements of the list must be of a type that belongs to the `Ord` type class. However, your function's type signature, `incr :: [a] -> Bool`, states that it can take a list of any type `a`. There's no guarantee that `a` is an instance of `Ord`, which is why Haskell raises an error.

4. **How to Fix It**: To fix this, you need to specify in your type signature that `a` must be an instance of the `Ord` type class. This is done by adding a type class constraint to your function's type signature. After adding the constraint, your function will only accept lists whose elements are of a type that can be ordered, thus satisfying the requirements of the `<` operator.

5. **Avoiding Specific Code**: As per your request, I won't provide the exact modified code. However, think about how you can modify the type signature of your function to include a constraint that ensures `a` is an instance of `Ord`. This way, the function knows that it can safely use the `<` operator on elements of the list.

By understanding these concepts, you'll be able to modify your function's type signature appropriately and resolve the error.
