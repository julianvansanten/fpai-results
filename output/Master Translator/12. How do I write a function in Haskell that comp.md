To write a function in Haskell that computes the dividers of a given number, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Concept of Dividers**: A divider (or divisor) of a number is a number that divides it completely, leaving no remainder. For example, the dividers of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

2. **Basic Function Structure in Haskell**: Haskell functions are defined with a name, parameters, and the function body. The syntax is `functionName :: Type -> Type`, followed by `functionName parameters = body`.

3. **Decide on the Function Signature**: Your function will take an integer and return a list of integers (the dividers). So, the signature could be `dividers :: Int -> [Int]`.

4. **Implementing the Logic**: You need to check each number from 1 to the given number to see if it's a divider. In Haskell, this can be done using list comprehension.

5. **Using List Comprehension**: In Haskell, list comprehension is a concise way to create lists. You can use it to build a list of numbers that divide your input number without a remainder.

6. **Testing for Divisibility**: To test if a number 'n' is divisible by another number 'd', you check if `n 'mod' d == 0`.

7. **Putting It All Together**: Combine these elements in your function. Use list comprehension to iterate over a range of numbers (from 1 to the input number), and select those for which the divisibility test passes.

8. **Handling Edge Cases**: Consider what should happen if the input number is zero or negative. You might want to return an empty list or handle these cases differently.

Remember, while writing Haskell functions, it's important to think in terms of expressions and transformations of data, as Haskell is a purely functional language. Also, testing your function with various inputs can help ensure it works correctly.
