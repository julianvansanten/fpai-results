A question is asked by a student: "What is a higher-order function?"
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

A higher-order function is a concept in functional programming that refers to a function which either takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result. This is different from first-order functions, which don't work with functions as inputs or outputs.

For example, a higher-order function could be one that takes a function as an argument and applies it to a list of items. Another example is a function that returns a new function, possibly configured in some way by the parameters passed to the higher-order function.

In essence, higher-order functions allow functions to be used as variables or data, enabling more abstract and potentially more concise code. They are a key part of many functional programming languages and paradigms, allowing for powerful programming techniques like function composition, currying, and functional decorators or wrappers.
