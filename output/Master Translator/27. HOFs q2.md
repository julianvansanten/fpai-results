A question is asked by a student: "I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

Why should the type of isPrime be `Int -> Bool`? I want to make `primes :: [Int] -> [Int]`, but if I make `isPrime :: Int -> Bool`, the type will become `[Int] -> [Bool]`."

The confusion here arises from a misunderstanding of the types and the way `map` operates in Haskell.

First, let's clarify the role of the `isPrime` function. This function is intended to check whether a given integer is a prime number. If it is a prime, it should return `True`, otherwise `False`. Therefore, its correct type should indeed be `Int -> Bool`. The error message you received after changing `isPrime` to return a Boolean value (`Bool`) was because the `map (isPrime)` expression then tried to map a function that returns `Bool` over a list of `Int`, resulting in a list of `Bool`.

To achieve what you're aiming for with `primes :: [Int] -> [Int]`, you need to use a function that filters the list of integers, keeping only those for which `isPrime` returns `True`. In Haskell, this is typically done using the `filter` function. 

Here's a conceptual explanation without providing the code:

- Your `isPrime` function should have the type `Int -> Bool`. It checks if a number is prime.
- You should use `filter` instead of `map` for the `primes` function. The `filter` function takes a predicate (a function that returns a `Bool`) and a list, and it returns a new list containing only those elements of the original list for which the predicate returns `True`.
- Thus, `primes` should use `filter isPrime` to process the input list. This will result in a list of integers (`[Int]`) where each integer is a prime number, as determined by your `isPrime` function.

By applying these concepts, you should be able to modify your `primes` function to work as intended, returning a list of prime numbers from a given list of integers.
