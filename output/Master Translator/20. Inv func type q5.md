A question is asked by a student: "I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
Implement this function using a higher-order function."
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

The error message `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’` indicates that the Haskell type system requires a guarantee that the elements of the list can be ordered (i.e., compared with `<`). In your function definition `incr :: [a] -> Bool`, the type variable `a` is unrestricted, which means it could be any type, including those for which `<` is not defined.

To resolve this, you need to constrain the type `a` to be a member of the `Ord` type class, which includes all types that support ordering operations like `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. You can do this by changing the type signature of your function to `incr :: Ord a => [a] -> Bool`.

Regarding the use of a higher-order function, one approach is to utilize the `zipWith` function. `zipWith` takes a function and two lists as arguments and combines the lists by applying the function to each pair of elements. In your case, you can use `zipWith` to apply the `<` operator to each adjacent pair of elements in the list. Then, you can use the `all` function to check if all comparisons return `True`.

Here's a hint on how to implement the function with `zipWith` and `all`:
- Use `zipWith (<)` to create a list of Boolean values where each value represents whether an element in the list is less than its successor.
- Then, apply `all id` to this list of Booleans to check if all values are `True`.

This approach adheres to the principles of functional programming by using higher-order functions and avoids explicit recursion.
