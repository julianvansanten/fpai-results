A question is asked by a student: "I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
Give an implementation without this error."
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

The error you're encountering, `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`, is due to Haskell's type system. In your function definition `incr :: [a] -> Bool`, the type variable `a` can be any type, but the usage of `<` in `x < y` requires `a` to be a type that supports ordering comparisons, like numbers or characters. This is where the `Ord` type class comes into play in Haskell, which defines types that have ordering.

To fix this error, you need to specify that the elements of your list are of a type that belongs to the `Ord` type class. This is done by adding a type class constraint to your function signature.

Here's how you can modify your function without changing its logic:

1. Update the type signature to include the `Ord` constraint. This tells Haskell that your function only works on lists where the elements can be ordered.

2. Keep the logic of your function the same. Your recursive approach is fine.

I won't write the exact code to maintain the educational integrity of your assignment, but with these hints, you should be able to revise your function and resolve the error. Remember to add the `Ord a =>` constraint before your type declaration, which ensures that your function works as intended.
