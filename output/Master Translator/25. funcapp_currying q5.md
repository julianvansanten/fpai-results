A question is asked by a student: "A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
Generate example code that explains how to use function `f`."
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

The error message you're encountering is because of how the function `f` is called with the arguments. In Haskell, when you write `f (1, 2)`, it interprets `(1, 2)` as a single argument which is a tuple, not as two separate arguments. However, the function `f` is defined to take two separate arguments, not a tuple.

To correctly use the function `f`, you should call it by providing two separate arguments, like this: `f 1 2`. This way, `1` is passed as the first argument (`x`) and `2` as the second argument (`y`). The function will then correctly add these two numbers.

Here's a little explanation of how it works:

- `f x y = x + y` is a function definition where `f` takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum.
- When you call `f 1 2`, `1` replaces `x` and `2` replaces `y`, resulting in `1 + 2`.
- Thus, `f 1 2` evaluates to `3`.

Remember, in Haskell, functions are applied by writing the function name followed by its arguments separated by spaces, not by enclosing the arguments in parentheses like in some other languages. This is a common point of confusion for those new to Haskell or functional programming in general.
