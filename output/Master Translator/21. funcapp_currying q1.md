A question is asked by a student: "A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
What does this mean?"
The teacher of the Introductory Functional Programming course helps the student without providing code:

The error message you're seeing in Haskell is related to how you're calling the function `f x y = x + y` with the arguments `(1, 2)`. Let's break down the error message and the issue:

1. **Function Definition**: Your function `f` is defined to take two arguments, `x` and `y`. It's important to note that in Haskell, functions are curried by default. This means that `f x y` is actually a function that takes an argument `x` and returns another function, which then takes `y`.

2. **Calling the Function**: When you call `f (1, 2)`, you are passing a single argument: a tuple `(1, 2)`. Haskell interprets this as trying to apply `f` to this tuple, rather than applying `f` to two separate arguments `1` and `2`.

3. **Error Message**: The error message `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer)))` is essentially saying that Haskell cannot display the result of your function call. This is because it expects `f` to be applied to two arguments separately, not a single tuple. The part about `maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?` is a hint that the function `f` is not fully applied, as it was expecting two separate arguments.

To resolve this, you need to call the function with two separate arguments, like `f 1 2`, not as a tuple like `(1, 2)`. In this way, `f` will be applied first to `1`, resulting in a function that takes the next argument, and then applied to `2`, resulting in the final computation of `1 + 2`.
