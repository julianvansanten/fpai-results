In Haskell, writing a Bubble Sort algorithm involves understanding the functional programming paradigm, which is quite different from the imperative style used in languages like C++ or Java. Instead of using loops and mutable variables, Haskell relies on recursion and immutable variables. Here's a conceptual explanation to help you write Bubble Sort in Haskell:

1. **Understanding the Basics**: Haskell is a pure functional language, so you'll use recursion for iteration and lists as your primary data structure.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem**: The Bubble Sort algorithm repeatedly passes through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

3. **Recursive Approach**: In Haskell, you would typically implement this with two functions:
   - An outer function that calls the inner function and checks if any swaps have been made. If swaps have occurred, it calls itself recursively with the newly sorted (partially) list.
   - An inner function that performs a single pass through the list, swapping elements as needed.

4. **The Inner Function**:
   - This function takes a list and returns a tuple: the partially sorted list and a boolean indicating whether any swap was made.
   - Use pattern matching to handle different cases: an empty list, a single-element list (which is already sorted), and a list with multiple elements.
   - Compare the first two elements of the list; if they are out of order, swap them and continue with the rest of the list.

5. **The Outer Function**:
   - It calls the inner function and checks the boolean part of the returned tuple.
   - If a swap was made (

(boolean is `True`), it calls itself recursively with the sorted part of the list.
   - If no swap was made (`False`), it means the list is already sorted, and the function can return the sorted list.

6. **Base Case and Recursive Case**: Remember to define the base case for your recursion to avoid infinite loops. In Bubble Sort, a natural base case is when no swaps are needed in a pass, indicating that the list is sorted.

7. **Immutable Variables**: Keep in mind that in Haskell, variables are immutable. When you "modify" a list, you are actually creating a new list. This is a fundamental aspect of functional programming.

8. **Testing Your Function**: After implementing your function, test it with different lists to ensure it sorts correctly. Haskell's strong typing system and pure functional nature can help catch many errors at compile time.

9. **Leverage Haskell's Features**: Haskell has a rich standard library and powerful features like pattern matching, higher-order functions, and strong type inference which can make your implementation concise and elegant.

Remember, while I can't provide you with the exact code, this outline should give you a good starting point to implement Bubble Sort in Haskell. Experiment with different approaches and see how Haskell's features can be leveraged to implement this classic sorting algorithm.
