## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
How do I write bubble sort in Haskell?


## ChatGPT

To guide you towards understanding how to write a bubble sort algorithm in Haskell, a functional programming language, here are three questions that can help you unravel the underlying concepts:

1. **Understanding Recursion in Functional Programming**: Bubble sort involves repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. How would you approach this iterative process in Haskell, considering its emphasis on recursion over traditional looping mechanisms?

2. **Immutable Data Structures in Haskell**: Haskell is known for its use of immutable data structures. How might this characteristic influence the way you implement a sorting algorithm like bubble sort, especially in terms of managing and updating the list of elements?

3. **Higher-Order Functions and Local Definitions**: Haskell allows the use of higher-order functions and encourages local definitions. How can these features be utilized to simplify the implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, and what might be the advantages of using them in this context?
