## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
What does `Ord a` mean?


## ChatGPT

To guide you through understanding the error message and the underlying concepts, consider these questions:

1. Can you explain what type classes are in Haskell, and how they relate to functions and types?
2. How does Haskell determine whether a particular operation, like `<`, can be used with a given type?
3. What is the `Ord` type class, and which types are typically members of this class? How does this relate to the use of the `<` operator in your function?
