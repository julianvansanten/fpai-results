## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
What is the difference between bubble sort in Python and in Haskell?


## ChatGPT

1. How do Python and Haskell differ in their approach to handling data structures like lists, which are commonly used in sorting algorithms?
2. Can you explain the concept of mutability in Python and how it contrasts with Haskell's approach to data?
3. In what ways does the paradigm of functional programming in Haskell influence the implementation of algorithms like bubble sort compared to the imperative style in Python?
