## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
Define a higher order function `itn` (for “iterate `n` times”) with three arguments `f`, `a`, `n` in Haskell.


## ChatGPT

To guide your understanding of defining a higher order function `itn` in Haskell, consider these questions:

1. What are the key characteristics of higher order functions in functional programming, and how does `itn` fit into this category?
2. Can you explain the roles of each of the arguments `f`, `a`, and `n` in the context of `itn`? What types might these arguments have?
3. How does Haskell handle recursion, and how might this concept be applied to create a function that iterates `n` times?
