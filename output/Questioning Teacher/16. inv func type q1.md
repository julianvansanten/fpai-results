## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
How do I fix this?


## ChatGPT

It's great that you're exploring functional programming and Haskell! Let's dive into your question with some guiding inquiries that can help you understand the concepts involved:

1. **Understanding Type Constraints**: Can you explain what the `Ord` typeclass represents in Haskell, and why certain operations, like `<`, require it?

2. **Exploring Type Signatures**: How does the type signature of your function `incr` relate to the error message? What might be missing in the type signature that leads to this error?

3. **Applying Type Constraints in Functions**: How can you modify the type signature of your `incr` function to ensure it only accepts lists of elements that can be ordered (i.e., compared with `<`)? 

These questions should lead you to a deeper understanding of type constraints in Haskell and how they apply to your function.
