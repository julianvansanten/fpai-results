## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
Give a function call that works.

To guide you towards understanding the error and finding a solution, consider these questions:

1. How does Haskell interpret the syntax of function arguments? Specifically, think about the difference between `f (1, 2)` and `f 1 2`.
   
2. What does the error message imply about the number of arguments you are passing to the function `f`? Consider what "haven't applied a function to enough arguments" might mean in the context of your function call.
   
3. Reflect on the concept of tuples in Haskell. How does Haskell treat a pair of values enclosed in parentheses (like `(1, 2)`) compared to two separate values? 

These questions are designed to lead you towards a deeper understanding of function application and argument passing in Haskell.
