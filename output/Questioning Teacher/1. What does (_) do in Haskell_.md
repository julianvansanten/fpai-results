## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
What does (:) do in Haskell?


## ChatGPT

1. Can you describe the types of elements and structures that the `(:)` operator works with in Haskell?
2. How does the `(:)` operator relate to the concept of list construction or manipulation in Haskell?
3. What are some examples of scenarios or problems where you might use the `(:)` operator, and how does it affect the overall structure of the data you're working with?
