## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
What is a higher-order function?


## ChatGPT

1. Can you explain what differentiates a higher-order function from a regular function in terms of its inputs and outputs?
2. How does a higher-order function utilize other functions in its operation?
3. Can you think of an example from everyday life or mathematics where a process (or function) uses another process (or function) to complete its task?
