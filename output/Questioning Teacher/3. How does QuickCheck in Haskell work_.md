## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
How does QuickCheck in Haskell work?


## ChatGPT

1. Can you explain what property-based testing is and how it differs from example-based testing?
2. How do you think QuickCheck in Haskell generates test cases for different data types?
3. What role do you believe randomness plays in the functionality of QuickCheck?
