## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
Implement this function using a higher-order function.


## ChatGPT

Your question about the `incr` function and the error you're encountering in Haskell touches upon several key concepts in functional programming. Let's explore these concepts through the following questions:

1. Can you explain what the `Ord a` error means in the context of Haskell's type system? This will help you understand why the compiler is complaining about the use of `<`.

2. How do higher-order functions differ from regular functions, and how can they be utilized in this scenario? Reflecting on this will guide you towards rethinking the implementation strategy.

3. What are some common higher-order functions in Haskell that operate on lists, and how might they be used to compare elements within a list? This question is directly aimed at guiding you towards the appropriate higher-order function for your task.
