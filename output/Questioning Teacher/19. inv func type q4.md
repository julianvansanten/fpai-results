## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
Give an implementation without this error.


## ChatGPT

As a teacher, I'll guide you through understanding the problem and finding a solution without directly providing the code. Let's explore the underlying concepts:

1. Can you explain what the type constraint `(Ord a)` implies for a function in Haskell and why it might be necessary for your `incr` function?

2. How does Haskell determine if an element in a list can be compared using '<' or '>'? What does it mean for a type to be a member of the `Ord` class?

3. In your current function definition, `incr :: [a] -> Bool`, the type variable `a` is unrestricted. How can you modify the type declaration to ensure that `a` belongs to a type that can be ordered (i.e., has an instance of `Ord`)?
