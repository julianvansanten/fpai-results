## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
Explain the mathematics behind functional programming.


## ChatGPT

That's a great question! To better understand the mathematics behind functional programming, let's explore some underlying concepts:

1. **Lambda Calculus**: How does lambda calculus, as a formal system in mathematical logic, relate to functional programming in terms of expressing computation based on function abstraction and application?
   
2. **Immutability and Pure Functions**: Can you explain how the concept of immutability in functional programming is related to mathematical functions, and why pure functions (functions without side effects) are important in this paradigm?
   
3. **Function Composition and Higher-Order Functions**: How do the concepts of function composition and higher-order functions in functional programming mirror similar concepts in mathematics, and what role do they play in structuring functional programs?
