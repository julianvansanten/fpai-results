## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
How do I write a discriminant function in Haskell?


## ChatGPT

That's a great question about writing a discriminant function in Haskell! To guide you through understanding the underlying concepts, let's consider these questions:

1. **Understanding Functions in Haskell**: Can you explain how to define a basic function in Haskell, including its structure and how it handles input parameters?
2. **Mathematical Concepts**: Are you familiar with the mathematical formula for calculating the discriminant? How would you describe this formula in your own words?
3. **Type System in Haskell**: How does Haskell's type system work, particularly in relation to mathematical functions? For instance, what types would you use for the inputs and output of the discriminant function?
