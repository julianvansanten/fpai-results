## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
What is the difference between list comprehension and set builder notation?


## ChatGPT

That's a great question! To help you understand the difference between list comprehension and set builder notation in functional programming, consider these questions:

1. How does list comprehension in functional programming languages like Python or Haskell generate elements, and how does this process compare to the way set builder notation defines elements in mathematics?
2. What are the similarities and differences in the syntax and structure of list comprehension and set builder notation?
3. Can you think of an example where list comprehension and set builder notation would yield different results, especially in terms of duplicates and ordering of elements?
