## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
How can I use the function `f` with `(1, 2)`?

It's great that you're delving into functional programming and exploring Haskell. To guide you towards understanding the error and resolving it, consider these questions:

1. How does function application work in Haskell, particularly in terms of how arguments are passed to functions? Think about the difference between passing a single tuple as an argument versus passing multiple arguments separately.

2. Can you identify the difference in syntax between calling a function with a tuple as a single argument and calling it with two separate arguments? Reflect on how this distinction relates to the error message you received.

3. What does the error message suggest about the expected input for the function `f`? Consider how the structure of the input you provided may differ from what the function expects.
