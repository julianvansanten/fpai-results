## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
What is the difference between a Python list and a Haskell list?


## ChatGPT

To help you explore the differences between a Python list and a Haskell list in the context of functional programming, consider these guiding questions:

1. How do Python and Haskell treat data structures in terms of mutability, and what impact does this have on the lists in each language?
2. Can you describe the differences in how lists are implemented in Python, a multi-paradigm language, and Haskell, a purely functional language, especially in terms of memory management and efficiency?
3. What are the conceptual differences in how lists are used in Python and Haskell, particularly in relation to functional programming principles like recursion and higher-order functions?
