## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
What is the difference between partial application and currying?


## ChatGPT

1. How would you describe the process of breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take one argument each?
2. Can you explain how partial application allows you to fix a certain number of arguments of a function, creating a new function?
3. In what situations might you use currying over partial application, and vice versa, in functional programming?
