## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
What does this mean?


## ChatGPT

This error message from Haskell can indeed be perplexing for beginners. Here are three questions to guide your understanding:

1. Can you describe how Haskell interprets the types of the function arguments in `f x y = x + y`? Think about what each variable `x` and `y` represents.
2. Reflect on the syntax of the function call `f (1, 2)`. How does Haskell understand the input `(1, 2)` in relation to the expected function arguments?
3. Considering Haskell's type system and the error message, what might be the significance of the phrase "maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?" How does this relate to the way you've called the function `f`?
