## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

Why should the type of isPrime be `Int -> Bool`? I want to make `primes :: [Int] -> [Int]`, but if I make `isPrime :: Int -> Bool`, the type will become `[Int] -> [Bool]`.

Your questions indicate that you're grappling with the concepts of types and function composition in Haskell. Let's explore these concepts through some guiding questions:

1. **Understanding Function Types:** In Haskell, what does the function type signature represent, particularly in the context of `Int -> Bool` and `Int -> Int`? How does the return type of a function affect its usability in other functions or compositions?

2. **Exploring the `map` Function:** How does the `map` function work in Haskell? Specifically, what is the relationship between the type of the function passed to `map` and the type of the list it returns?

3. **Function Composition and Types:** Given your goal to create a `primes :: [Int] -> [Int]` function, how can you modify the `isPrime` function or the `primes` function to ensure the types align correctly? What strategies can you use in Haskell to transform a list of one type into a list of another type, based on a condition or a predicate?

Reflecting on these questions should help you understand how to correctly implement the `primes` function while maintaining the desired types.
