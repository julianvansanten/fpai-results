## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

How else can I define `primes`?

It sounds like you're encountering type mismatch issues in your Haskell code. To guide you towards understanding and resolving these issues, consider the following questions:

1. What is the expected return type of the `isPrime` function based on its usage within the `primes` function? Think about the type of data `isPrime` needs to provide so that it can be effectively used by `map` in `primes`.

2. How does the `map` function work in Haskell, especially in terms of the types of its arguments and the type of its result? Reflect on how `map` applies a function to each element of a list and what that means for the types involved.

3. Can you identify the relationship between the types in the error messages and the types defined in your functions? Consider how the type signatures of your functions align with the operations and comparisons you're performing within those functions.
