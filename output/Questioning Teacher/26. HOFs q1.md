## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

How can I fix this?

Your question about the `primes` function in Haskell is a great opportunity to explore some fundamental concepts in functional programming. Here are three questions that can guide your understanding and problem-solving process:

1. **Understanding Function Types**: Can you explain the expected type signature for the `isPrime` function based on its implementation? This involves understanding what the function does and what type of data it should return. How does this relate to the error message you received about type mismatch?

2. **Exploring Function Compositions**: How does the `map` function work in Haskell, and what type of function does it expect as its first argument? Consider the role of `map` in your `primes` function and how it interacts with the `isPrime` function.

3. **Analyzing Type Errors**: Can you break down the type error messages you received and relate them to the functions involved? Think about what these errors imply about the types in your functions and how they might be conflicting. 

Reflecting on these questions should help you pinpoint the issues in your code and guide you towards resolving them.
