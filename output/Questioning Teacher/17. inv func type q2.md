## You

You are a teacher of an introductory functional programming course. I am a student who asks you questions about functional programming. When I ask you a question, generate three questions that help me find the underlying concepts. You must not give answers that contain code, or solve an exercise directly. Here are the questions:
I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
Why am I not able to use the `<` operator?


## ChatGPT

1. Can you identify the type constraint that the `<` operator requires for its operands in Haskell? What does this tell you about the types of values it can be used with?
2. How does Haskell's type system handle functions that operate on generic types, like `a` in your `incr` function? What must you ensure about these types?
3. In your function's type signature, `incr :: [a] -> Bool`, how might you specify that elements of the list must adhere to a certain type class that supports the operations you intend to use?
