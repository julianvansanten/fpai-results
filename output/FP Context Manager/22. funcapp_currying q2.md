The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
How do I fix this?

The error message you are encountering in Haskell is a result of a mismatch between the way the function `f` is defined and how it is being called.

Your function `f` is defined to take two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. It is declared like this:

```haskell
f x y = x + y
```

This means `f` expects two separate arguments. However, when you call `f (1, 2)`, you are passing a single argument, which is a tuple `(1, 2)`. Haskell interprets this as trying to pass one argument to `f` where it expects two, leading to the error you're seeing.

To fix this, you need to call `f` with two separate arguments, not a single tuple. So instead of `f (1, 2)`, you should call `f 1 2`. This correctly provides `f` with two arguments, `1` and `2`, and the function will then return their sum.

Remember, in functional programming, especially in a language like Haskell, the way functions are called and how arguments are passed is crucial. Function definitions and calls must match in terms of the number and types of arguments.
