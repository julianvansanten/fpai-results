The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
What is the difference between list comprehension and set builder notation?

List comprehension and set builder notation are both ways to define collections of elements, but they are used in different contexts and have some distinct characteristics.

1. **Context and Usage**:
   - **List Comprehension**: This is a concept used in programming, particularly in functional programming languages and languages with functional programming features, like Python, Haskell, and Scala. List comprehension allows for the creation of lists based on existing lists or iterables, using a concise and readable syntax.
   - **Set Builder Notation**: This is a mathematical notation used to define sets. It's a part of set theory in mathematics and is used to concisely express the members of a set based on a property or rule.

2. **Syntax and Structure**:
   - **List Comprehension**: Typically involves brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, and then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses. The expression can be anything that results in a list, transforming the items taken from the iterable.
   - **Set Builder Notation**: Involves curly braces and often includes a variable, a condition (or rule), and a colon or vertical bar. It defines a set in terms of a general rule or condition that its members must satisfy.

3. **Purpose and Output**:
   - **List Comprehension**: Used to create a new list where each element is the result of some operation applied to each member of an existing iterable or sequence. It's often used for filtering and transforming data within programming.
   - **Set Builder Notation**: Used to describe the properties that characterize the members of a set. It's a formal way of defining sets by specifying a property that its members must satisfy, without having to list out all the elements.

4. **Deterministic Order and Duplicates**:
   - **List Comprehension**: The order of elements in the resulting list is deterministic, following the order of the original iterable. It can also include duplicate elements if they occur in the source data.
   - **Set Builder Notation**: As it defines sets, the order of elements is not relevant, and duplicates are not allowed. Each element in a set is unique.

5. **Practical Use**:
   - **List Comprehension**: Widely used in programming for data manipulation, filtering, and transformation within programs.
   - **Set Builder Notation**: More theoretical and used in mathematical proofs, discussions, and to convey mathematical concepts.

In summary, while both list comprehension and set builder notation are tools for defining collections based on certain rules or conditions, list comprehension is a programming construct used for creating lists, often with an emphasis on transformation and filtering, whereas set builder notation is a mathematical concept used for defining sets with unique elements based on a property.
