To write a function in Haskell that computes the dividers of a given number, you should follow a functional approach, focusing on the concepts of list comprehension, filtering, and the use of lambda expressions. Here's a conceptual breakdown of how you can approach this problem:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find all the dividers of a given number. A divider (or divisor) of a number is any number that divides it without leaving a remainder.

2. **Use of List Comprehension**: Haskell excels in dealing with lists, and list comprehension is a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. You can use list comprehension to generate a list of potential dividers.

3. **Range of Potential Dividers**: The potential dividers of a number n are all the numbers from 1 to n. However, in practice, you only need to check up to the square root of n, as dividers larger than the square root will have corresponding smaller dividers that have already been found.

4. **Filtering**: You need to filter out the numbers that are not actual dividers of the given number. This is done by checking if the remainder of the division of the given number by the potential divider is zero.

5. **Lambda Expressions and Functions**: In Haskell, you can use lambda expressions or define helper functions to encapsulate the logic for checking if a number is a divider.

6. **Putting It All Together**: Combine these concepts to create a function that takes a number as input and returns a list of its dividers. Use list comprehension to iterate over the range of potential dividers, and use a filtering condition to select only those numbers that divide the given number without a remainder.

Remember, in functional programming, the emphasis is on using pure functions without side effects, and Haskell is particularly strict about this paradigm. Your function should be a pure function, meaning its output should only depend on its input, and it should not modify any state or have any side effects.
