The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
Why am I not able to use the `<` operator?

The error message you're encountering in Haskell, `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`, is due to a type constraint issue. In Haskell, not all types are inherently comparable using ordering operators like `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=`. These operators are part of the `Ord` type class, which means they can only be used with types that are instances of `Ord`.

In your function `incr`, you have defined the type signature as `incr :: [a] -> Bool`. Here, `a` is a type variable that can represent any type. However, since you're using the `<` operator in your function, you need to restrict `a` to types that are members of the `Ord` type class. This is because the `<` operator can only be applied to types that have an ordering defined.

To fix this error, you should specify that `a` must be an instance of the `Ord` type class in your type signature. This is done by adding a type class constraint to `a`. 

Remember, in functional programming, especially in a language like Haskell, being explicit about types and their constraints is crucial for both correctness and understanding of your code. This error is a good example of how Haskell's type system helps in ensuring that functions are used with appropriate types.
