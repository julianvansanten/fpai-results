The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
Define a higher order merge sort function hoSort in Haskell, in which the relation by which a list should be sorted is given as an argument `r`.

In functional programming, a higher-order function is one that either takes other functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. In the context of your question, the `hoSort` function in Haskell, which you're asking to define as a higher-order version of merge sort, would take a comparison function `r` as an argument. This function `r` is used to determine the order in which elements are sorted.

Here's a conceptual breakdown of how you would define `hoSort`:

1. **Function Signature**: Your `hoSort` function will have a type signature that reflects its higher-order nature. It would take a comparison function `r` and a list to sort as its arguments.

2. **Comparison Function (`r`)**: The comparison function `r` takes two arguments (say, `x` and `y`) and returns a Boolean. It defines the sorting order. For instance, if `r x y` returns `True`, it means `x` should come before `y` in the sorted list.

3. **Divide**: Implement the logic to divide the list into sublists. Typically, this is done by splitting the list in half until you have lists that are either empty or have a single element.

4. **Conquer**: Sort these smaller lists. Since they are of size 0 or 1, they are already "sorted".

5. **Merge**: Combine these sorted sublists back together. This is where the comparison function `r` is crucial. You'll merge the lists by repeatedly choosing the smaller head element according to the ordering defined by `r`.

6. **Recursive Structure**: The nature of merge sort is recursive, so your `hoSort` function will call itself when dealing with sublists.

7. **Base Case**: Remember to define a base case for the recursion, typically when the list is empty or has a single element.

8. **Returning the Sorted List**: Finally, `hoSort` will return the sorted list.

Remember, the key to implementing `hoSort` in a functional style is to avoid mutable state and to use recursion and higher-order functions effectively. This approach is very much in line with Haskell's design and functional programming principles.
