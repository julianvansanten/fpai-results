The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
Give a function call that works.


## ChatGPT

In Haskell, the function `f x y = x + y` defines a function `f` that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`. When you call `f (1, 2)`, you are actually passing a single argument, which is a tuple `(1, 2)`. This does not match the expected two separate arguments.

To correctly call the function `f` with the values `1` and `2`, you should separate the arguments with a space, not enclose them in parentheses as a tuple. The correct function call would be `f 1 2`. This passes `1` as the first argument and `2` as the second argument to the function `f`.
