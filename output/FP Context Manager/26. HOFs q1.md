The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

How can I fix this?

To address the issues you're facing with your Haskell code, let's analyze the errors and the intended functionality step by step.

1. **Type Mismatch in `isPrime` Function**: The first error you encountered is due to a type mismatch in the `isPrime` function. The function signature you provided expects the function to return an `Int`, but the implementation returns a `Bool`. This is because `divisers n == [1, n]` is a boolean expression, checking whether `n` is prime.

2. **Correcting the `isPrime` Function**: To fix this, you need to change the type signature of `isPrime` to `Int -> Bool`. This correctly indicates that the function takes an `Int` and returns a `Bool`.

3. **Issue with `primes` Function**: After correcting `isPrime`, you encountered another error in the `primes` function. This is because `map (isPrime)` is being used, but the function `isPrime` returns a `Bool`, not an `Int`. The `map` function will transform each element of the list to a `Bool`, resulting in a list of booleans, not a list of integers.

4. **Implementing the `primes` Function**: The `primes` function should filter the list of integers, keeping only those that are prime. Instead of using `map`, you should use a filtering function, like `filter`, that applies the `isPrime` predicate to each element of the input list. The `filter` function will retain only those elements for which `isPrime` returns `True`.

Remember, in functional programming, understanding and correctly using types is crucial. Functions like `map`, `filter`, and others are fundamental tools, and knowing when and how to use them is key to solving problems effectively. In your case, aligning the type signatures and using the appropriate higher-order function (`filter` instead of `map`) will resolve the issues.
