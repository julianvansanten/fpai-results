The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
Why is `[1,2,3]` the same as `1 : 2 : 3 : []` in Haskell?

In Haskell, a list is essentially a chain of elements constructed using the cons operator `(:)`. The expression `1 : 2 : 3 : []` illustrates this process.

1. **Cons Operator (`:`)**: In Haskell, the `:` operator is used to construct lists. It takes two arguments: the first is a single element and the second is a list. The operator prepends the single element to the front of the list.

2. **Building the List Step-by-Step**:
   - `3 : []` creates a list with the single element `3`. The `[]` is an empty list, so this expression results in `[3]`.
   - `2 : [3]` then prepends `2` to the list `[3]`, resulting in `[2, 3]`.
   - `1 : [2, 3]` finally prepends `1` to the list `[2, 3]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Equivalent to Direct List Notation**: The notation `[1, 2, 3]` is syntactic sugar in Haskell. It's a more concise and readable way to represent a list, but under the hood, it's interpreted just like `1 : 2 : 3 : []`.

In summary, both `[1,2,3]` and `1 : 2 : 3 : []` represent the same list in Haskell. The former is just a shorthand notation for the latter, which explicitly shows the list being constructed element-by-element using the cons operator. This illustrates the recursive and compositional nature of lists in functional programming.
