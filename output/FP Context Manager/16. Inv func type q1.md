The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
How do I fix this?

The error message you're seeing, `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`, indicates that Haskell doesn't know if the elements in your list can be compared using the `<` operator. In Haskell, `<` is part of the `Ord` typeclass, which is used for types whose values can be ordered.

To fix this, you need to specify that the type `a` in your function must be a member of the `Ord` typeclass. This is done by adding a type constraint to your function definition. The corrected signature of your function would be:

```haskell
incr :: Ord a => [a] -> Bool
```

This tells Haskell that your function `incr` works for any type `a` as long as `a` is an instance of `Ord`, meaning it supports ordering operations like `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. This change should resolve the error you're encountering.
