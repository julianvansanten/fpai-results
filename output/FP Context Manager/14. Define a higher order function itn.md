The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
Define a higher order function `itn` (for “iterate `n` times”) with three arguments `f`, `a`, `n` in Haskell.

The `itn` function you're describing is a higher-order function in functional programming, particularly in Haskell. Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as their result. In your case, `itn` is a function that takes three arguments:

1. `f`: A function to be applied.
2. `a`: An initial value that `f` will be applied to.
3. `n`: The number of times the function `f` should be applied to the value.

Here's a conceptual breakdown of how `itn` works:

- **Initial Setup**: The function starts with the initial value `a`.
- **Iteration**: It applies the function `f` to `a`.
- **Repetition**: This process repeats `n` times. After each application, the result becomes the new input for `f` in the next iteration.
- **Termination**: After `n` iterations, the final result is returned.

In Haskell, this kind of function is typically implemented using recursion. The recursive structure allows the function to apply `f` repeatedly to its result. 

Here are the key concepts in implementing `itn`:

- **Base Case**: You need a base case for the recursion. When `n` is 0 (or less, depending on how you want to handle negative numbers), the function should return the current value without applying `f`.
- **Recursive Step**: If `n` is greater than 0, the function should apply `f` to `a` and then call itself (`itn`) with the new value, `f a`, and `n-1` as arguments.
- **Type Signature**: The type signature of `itn` will reflect that it takes a function, an initial value, and an integer, then returns a value of the same type as the initial value.

This function is a good example of how functional programming languages like Haskell utilize concepts like higher-order functions and recursion to achieve complex operations in a concise and expressive manner.
