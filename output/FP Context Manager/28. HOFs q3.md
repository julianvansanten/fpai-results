The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

How else can I define `primes`?

The issues you're encountering stem from a misunderstanding of type signatures and how they interact with your functions. Let's break it down conceptually to address the errors and redefine the `primes` function in a functional way:

1. **Understanding the Type Error in `isPrime`:**
   - Your original `isPrime` function is intended to check if a number is prime. However, the type signature `isPrime :: Int -> Int` suggests that it takes an `Int` and returns an `Int`, which isn't what your function actually does.
   - The function `isPrime` should return a `Bool` (True or False) indicating whether the number is prime. Therefore, its correct type signature should be `isPrime :: Int -> Bool`.

2. **Adjusting the `primes` Function:**
   - Your `primes` function is supposed to take a list of integers and return a list of prime numbers from that list.
   - Since `isPrime` returns a `Bool`, you cannot use `map` directly because `map` would transform each element in the list to either `True` or `False`, which is not what you want.
   - Instead, you should use a function that filters elements of a list based on a predicate. In functional programming, this is typically done using a `filter` function.
   - The `filter` function takes a predicate (a function that returns a `Bool`) and a list, and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the predicate returns `True`.

3. **Correcting the `divisers` Function:**
   - There is a small mistake in your `divisers` function. The condition `m \`mod\` n == 0` should be `n \`mod\` m == 0` to find the divisors of `n`.

By applying these concepts, you should be able to redefine the `primes` function using the `filter` function and the corrected `isPrime` function. Remember, in functional programming, focusing on the types and how functions transform and filter data is key to solving problems effectively.
