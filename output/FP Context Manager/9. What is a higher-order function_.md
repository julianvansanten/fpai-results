The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
What is a higher-order function?

A higher-order function in functional programming is a function that operates on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. In essence, it's a function that treats other functions as data. This concept is a core part of functional programming, enabling powerful techniques like function composition and functional abstraction. 

For example, a higher-order function can:
1. **Accept one or more functions as arguments:** This allows the higher-order function to use the passed-in functions in various ways, such as applying them to a set of data.
2. **Return a function as its result:** This allows for creating new functions dynamically, often based on some input parameters or conditions.

Higher-order functions are powerful tools in functional programming as they enable more abstract and reusable code, facilitating operations like mapping, filtering, and reducing over collections, among others.
