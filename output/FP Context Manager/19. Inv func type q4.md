The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
Give an implementation without this error.

The error message you're encountering in your Haskell function `incr` is due to the type signature `incr :: [a] -> Bool`. This signature implies that your function should work for any type `a`, but in your function, you're using the `<` operator, which requires that `a` is an instance of the `Ord` type class. This type class is used in Haskell for types that have a notion of order, such as numbers.

To fix the error, you need to constrain the type `a` to those types that are instances of the `Ord` type class. This way, Haskell knows that it's safe to use the `<` operator with elements of type `a`.

Here's how you can modify the type signature:

```haskell
incr :: (Ord a) => [a] -> Bool
```

With this change, your function specifies that it accepts a list of any type `a`, as long as `a` is an instance of `Ord`. This will resolve the error you're encountering. 

Remember, this change ensures that your function can be used with any type that has an ordering (like `Int`, `Float`, `Char`, etc.), but it won't work with types that don't have a natural ordering (like functions or generic tuples).
