The `(:)` operator in Haskell is known as the "cons" operator. It is used to construct lists. Essentially, it prepends a single element to the beginning of a list. In functional programming, especially in a language like Haskell, this is a fundamental operation for list manipulation.

When you use `(:)`, you place an element on the left side of the operator and a list on the right side. The result is a new list with the element added at the front. This operation is very efficient because it doesn't require modifying the original list; it simply creates a new list with the new element followed by the original elements.

For example, if you have an element `x` and a list `xs`, using `x : xs` will create a new list with `x` as the first element and the elements of `xs` following it. This operation is fundamental in recursive functions that process lists, as it's often used to construct the result step by step, adding one element at a time.
