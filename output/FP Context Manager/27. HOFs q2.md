The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

Why should the type of isPrime be `Int -> Bool`? I want to make `primes :: [Int] -> [Int]`, but if I make `isPrime :: Int -> Bool`, the type will become `[Int] -> [Bool]`.

Your question touches on a few fundamental concepts in functional programming, especially in Haskell, related to types and how functions interact with them.

1. **Error Explanation**: The error messages you're encountering are due to a mismatch in the expected and actual types of the functions you've defined.

2. **Understanding `isPrime` Function**: The function `isPrime` is intended to check whether a given number is prime. Therefore, its output should be a boolean value (`True` or `False`), indicating whether the number is prime (`True`) or not (`False`). This is why the type of `isPrime` should be `Int -> Bool`.

3. **Creating `primes` Function**: The challenge you're facing is in constructing the `primes` function. You want `primes` to take a list of integers and return a list of integers (specifically, the prime numbers from the input list). However, if you use `map isPrime`, as you've attempted, you'll transform each `Int` in your list into a `Bool`, resulting in a `[Bool]` type instead of `[Int]`.

4. **Functional Approach Solution**: In functional programming, when you need to filter a list based on a predicate (a function that returns a boolean), you typically use a `filter` function, not `map`. The `filter` function in Haskell takes a predicate and a list, and returns a new list containing only those elements of the original list for which the predicate returns `True`.

5. **Applying Concepts to Your Problem**:
    - You should use `filter` instead of `map` in your `primes` function. This will allow you to keep only those elements in the list that satisfy the `isPrime` predicate.
    - Modify `isPrime` to be of type `Int -> Bool`.
    - Use `filter isPrime` in your `primes` function definition to obtain a list of primes.

This approach aligns with functional programming principles, particularly leveraging higher-order functions like `filter` that take other functions as arguments to create more complex behaviors in a concise and expressive way.
