The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
What does this mean?

The error message you're encountering in Haskell is due to a mismatch between how you're calling the function `f` and how it's defined. Let's break down the error and the situation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `f x y = x + y` is defined to take two arguments, `x` and `y`, and return their sum. It's important to note that Haskell functions are curried by default, meaning they take one argument at a time.

2. **Function Call**: When you call `f (1, 2)`, you're actually passing a single argument, which is a tuple `(1, 2)`. Haskell interprets this as trying to apply the function `f` to one argument, not two separate arguments.

3. **Error Message Analysis**: The error message `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer)))` indicates a couple of things:
    - Haskell is trying to show (or print) the result of `f (1, 2)`.
    - It interprets `(1, 2)` as a single argument, and hence it's assuming `f` is a function that takes a tuple and returns a function (because of currying).
    - Since `f` is not designed to take a tuple, Haskell cannot find a way to display the result, leading to the error.

4. **Functional Programming Aspect**: In functional programming, understanding how functions are applied and how arguments are passed is crucial. The error stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of function application in a purely functional language like Haskell.

To correct the error, you should call the function with two separate arguments, like `f 1 2`, which passes `1` as `x` and `2` as `y`. This aligns with the function's definition and the way Haskell handles function calls.
