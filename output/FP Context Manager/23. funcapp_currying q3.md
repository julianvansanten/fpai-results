The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
How can I use the function `f` with `(1, 2)`?

In Haskell, when you're dealing with a function like `f x y = x + y`, it's defined to take two arguments separately, not as a tuple. This means you need to call the function with each argument provided individually, rather than as a single tuple.

However, if you want to use a tuple like `(1, 2)` with this function, you have a couple of options:

1. **Unpacking the Tuple**: You can write a wrapper function or directly unpack the tuple and apply the function `f` to its elements. For example, you can create a function that takes a tuple and then applies `f` to the two elements of that tuple.

2. **Modifying the Function**: Alternatively, you can redefine the function `f` to take a single argument that is a tuple, and then apply the operation to the elements of the tuple. 

Remember, in functional programming, the focus is often on transforming and passing data in a way that functions expect it, often by creating new functions or by transforming data to fit the expected input of existing functions. This highlights the importance of understanding how functions are defined and how their arguments are structured.
