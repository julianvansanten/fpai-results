The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
What does `Ord a` mean?

The error message `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’` in Haskell indicates a type class constraint issue.

In Haskell, `Ord` is a type class that provides an interface for ordering functions, such as `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. These functions are used to compare values and check if one is less than, greater than, equal to, or not equal to another. When you define a function like `incr`, which uses the `<` operator to compare elements in a list, Haskell expects the elements of the list to be of a type that is an instance of the `Ord` type class. This means that the elements should support ordering operations (i.e., it should be possible to determine if one element is less than, greater than, or equal to another).

In your function `incr :: [a] -> Bool`, the type variable `a` is not constrained, meaning it can be any type. However, since you are using the `<` operator, `a` needs to be constrained to types that are instances of `Ord`. You can fix this by adding an `Ord a =>` constraint to your function type signature, indicating that your function only works for lists whose elements are of a type that belongs to the `Ord` type class.

Remember, in functional programming, particularly in Haskell, type classes are a way to define functions that can operate on a variety of types, as long as those types meet certain constraints (like `Ord` for ordering). This helps in writing generic, reusable code while still maintaining strong type safety.
