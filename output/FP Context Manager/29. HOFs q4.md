The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

Rewrite the given code such that it works.

To address the issues in your Haskell code, let's start by examining each function and the errors you've encountered.

1. **divisers Function:** The definition of the `divisers` function is almost correct, but the condition inside the list comprehension should be `n `mod` m == 0` instead of `m `mod` n == 0`. The correct function definition should generate a list of all divisors of `n`.

2. **isPrime Function:** The error message you're encountering is due to a type mismatch. Your `isPrime` function is intended to return a `Bool` (True or False), indicating whether a number is prime or not. However, you've declared its type as `Int -> Int`, which means it takes an `Int` and returns an `Int`. This should be changed to `Int -> Bool`.

3. **primes Function:** You are trying to use `map` with `isPrime`, but `map` is not the correct function for this task. The `map` function applies a given function to each element of a list, but what you need here is to filter the list based on a condition (whether the number is prime or not). The correct function to use is `filter`, not `map`.

Considering these points, the revised functions should look something like this (in conceptual terms):

- Modify `divisers` to correctly list divisors of a number.
- Change the type signature of `isPrime` to `Int -> Bool`.
- Use `filter` in the `primes` function to filter out non-prime numbers from the list.

These changes should resolve the type errors and align the code with functional programming principles. Remember, in functional programming, the focus is on using functions that apply transformations or filters to data in a way that avoids mutable state and side effects.
