The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
What is the difference between partial application and currying?


## ChatGPT

In functional programming, both partial application and currying are techniques related to function arguments, but they are distinct in their approach and purpose.

**Currying**: Currying is a process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. It essentially breaks down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take one argument.

- For example, a function `f(x, y, z)` can be transformed into `f(x)(y)(z)`.
- The key aspect of currying is that it always produces nested unary (single-argument) functions for each argument of the original function.
- Currying is useful in situations where you want to incrementally apply functions or build higher-order functions that are more specific.

**Partial Application**: Partial application refers to the process of fixing a few arguments of a function, producing another function of smaller arity (fewer arguments). Unlike currying, which always breaks down into unary functions, partial application can fix any number of arguments and isn't restricted to creating only unary functions.

- For example, given a function `f(x, y, z)`, you can create a new function `g(y, z)` by partially applying `x`.
- Partial application is handy when you have a function that you often call with the same argument(s) and want to simplify subsequent calls.
- It differs from currying in that partial application can bind any number of arguments, and the resulting function may still take multiple arguments.

In summary, while both techniques involve working with functions and their arguments, currying is about transforming a function into a sequence of unary functions, and partial application is about fixing some arguments of a function to simplify it. Currying is a more formalized process specific to the arity of functions, whereas partial application is a more general concept of binding some arguments of a function.
