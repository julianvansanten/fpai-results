The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

Generate a function `primes` which gives all prime numbers out of a given list.

Your Haskell implementation of the `primes` function is close, but there are a few adjustments needed to make it work correctly. Let's go through the issues and how you can solve them using functional programming concepts.

### Issue with `divisers` Function
Firstly, there's a small mistake in your `divisers` function. The condition `m `mod` n == 0` should actually be `n `mod` m == 0`. This change will ensure that the function correctly finds all divisors of `n`.

### Correcting `isPrime` Function
Your `isPrime` function is intended to check if a number is prime. In Haskell, the type of a function that returns a Boolean value (True or False) should be `Bool`, not `Int`. The error message you're receiving is because you've incorrectly annotated `isPrime` as returning an `Int` when it actually returns a `Bool`. 

To fix this, you need to change the type signature of `isPrime` from `Int -> Int` to `Int -> Bool`. This change will reflect that `isPrime` is a predicate function, i.e., a function that tests whether a certain condition holds.

### Adjusting `primes` Function
Lastly, the `primes` function should take a list of integers and return a list of integers that are prime. The `map` function you've used is not suitable here because `map` applies a function to each element of a list and returns a list of results. In your case, you need a function that filters the list based on a condition (whether each number is prime or not). The correct function to use here is `filter`.

Using `filter`, you can apply `isPrime` to each element of the input list and retain only those elements for which `isPrime` returns `True`.

### Summary of Changes
1. Correct `divisers` to use `n `mod` m == 0`.
2. Change the type signature of `isPrime` to `Int -> Bool`.
3. Use `filter` instead of `map` in `primes` to filter out non-prime numbers.

With these changes, your `primes` function should work as expected, filtering the input list to return only the prime numbers. Remember, in functional programming, choosing the right higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, or `fold` is key to effective and clean code.
