How do I write bubble sort in Haskell?

In Haskell, which is a functional programming language, the approach to implementing algorithms like bubble sort is different from imperative languages. In functional programming, you focus on expressions and declarations rather than on executing commands.

To understand how you might write a bubble sort in Haskell, let's consider the key concepts:

1. **Immutability**: In functional programming, data structures are immutable. So, instead of modifying an array or list in place, you would create and return new lists with each operation.

2. **Recursion**: Functional languages favor recursion over looping constructs like `for` or `while` loops. Bubble sort involves repeatedly traversing the list and swapping elements if they are in the wrong order. In Haskell, this would typically be implemented using recursive functions.

3. **Higher-order functions**: Haskell makes extensive use of higher-order functions. These are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. For bubble sort, you might use higher-order functions for the comparison operation or to apply the swap operation across a list.

4. **Pure functions**: Haskell encourages the use of pure functions, which means that the functionâ€™s output value is consistent with its input values and that it has no side effects (like modifying global variables).

With these principles in mind, a bubble sort in Haskell would involve writing a function that recursively passes through the list, compares each pair of adjacent items, and swaps them if necessary. The process repeats until the list is sorted. Remember, each pass would generate a new list rather than modifying the original list.

To implement this, you would define a function to make one pass over the list, swapping elements as needed. Then, you would write a recursive function that keeps calling the single-pass function until the list is sorted.

This conceptual approach respects the principles of functional programming and demonstrates how you might think about and structure a bubble sort in Haskell.
