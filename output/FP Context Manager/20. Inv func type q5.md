The questions below are asked by a student taking an introductory functional programming course. Focus only on programming and problem-solving using a functional approach. Whenever the student asks for code, only answer in terms of concepts and never provide code. Here are the questions:
I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
Implement this function using a higher-order function.

The error you're encountering, "No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’", indicates that the Haskell compiler doesn't know whether the elements in your list can be ordered. In Haskell, the `<` operator is part of the `Ord` typeclass, which means it can only be used with types that have an ordering defined. The type signature of your function `incr :: [a] -> Bool` specifies that it can take a list of any type `a`, but not all types are orderable. 

To fix this, you need to constrain the type of elements in the list to those that can be ordered. This is done by adding a type constraint to your function's type signature. 

However, as you're also interested in implementing this function using a higher-order function, let's consider a functional approach. One higher-order function that fits well in this scenario is `zipWith`. This function applies a given binary function to two lists element-wise. In your case, you can use it to compare adjacent elements in the list.

Here's how you can approach it conceptually:

1. Use `zipWith` to apply the `<` operator to pairs of adjacent elements in your list. This will generate a list of Booleans.
2. Check that all the elements in this new list of Booleans are `True` using the `all` function, which returns `True` if all elements in a list satisfy a predicate.

Remember to add the type constraint for `Ord` to your function's type signature. This would ensure that your function only accepts lists whose elements can be compared using `<`. 

This approach leverages the power of higher-order functions to make your code more concise and expressive.
