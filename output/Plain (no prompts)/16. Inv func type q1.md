I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
How do I fix this?

The error you're encountering in Haskell arises because the type signature of your `incr` function does not enforce that the elements of the list must be orderable. In Haskell, the `<` operator is part of the `Ord` type class, which provides functionality for ordering comparisons. Your current type signature `incr :: [a] -> Bool` suggests that `incr` can work with a list of any type `a`, but this is not true since you need to be able to compare the elements with `<`.

To fix this, you need to constrain the type `a` to be an instance of the `Ord` type class. This is done by modifying the type signature of the function:

```haskell
incr :: (Ord a) => [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```

With this change, the function `incr` now explicitly requires that its elements are of a type that supports ordering. This should resolve the error you're experiencing.
