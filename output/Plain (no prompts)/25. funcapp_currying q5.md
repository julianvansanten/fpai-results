## You

A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
Generate example code that explains how to use function `f`.


## ChatGPT

The function `f` you've defined in Haskell is a simple addition function that expects two arguments. However, when you try to call it with `f (1, 2)`, you're actually passing a single argument, which is a tuple `(1, 2)`. This is why Haskell is throwing an error, as it expects two separate arguments, not a tuple.

To correctly use the `f` function, you should pass the arguments separately, like this: `f 1 2`. This way, `1` and `2` are passed as two distinct arguments to the function.

Here's an example code snippet in Haskell to demonstrate the correct usage:

```haskell
-- Define the function
f :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
f x y = x + y

-- Correctly call the function
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let result = f 1 2
    print result
```

In this example, `f 1 2` correctly passes `1` and `2` as separate arguments to `f`, and the function adds them together, returning `3`. The result is then printed to the console.
