I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
What does `Ord a` mean?

The error message `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’` in Haskell indicates that the function `incr` is expecting a type `a` that can be compared using the `<` operator, but Haskell cannot guarantee this for any type `a`. In Haskell, the `<` operator is part of the `Ord` typeclass, which is used for types whose values can be put in order, like numbers and characters.

To resolve this error, you need to specify that the type `a` in your function must be a member of the `Ord` typeclass. This is done by adding a type constraint to your function definition. Here's how you can modify your `incr` function:

```haskell
incr :: (Ord a) => [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```

With this modification, the function now specifies that it only works on lists where the element type `a` is an instance of the `Ord` typeclass, meaning that the elements can be compared using ordering operations like `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`. This should resolve the error you were encountering.
