I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
Give an implementation without this error.

The error you're encountering in your Haskell function arises because the type signature `incr :: [a] -> Bool` doesn't specify that the elements of the list should be of a type that can be ordered, which is required to use the `<` operator. In Haskell, this is typically done using the `Ord` type class.

To fix this, you should change the function's type signature to ensure that it only accepts lists of elements that can be compared. This is done by restricting the type variable `a` to types that are instances of the `Ord` type class. Here's how you can modify your function:

```haskell
incr :: (Ord a) => [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```

With this modification, the type signature `incr :: (Ord a) => [a] -> Bool` specifies that `incr` takes a list of any type `a`, as long as `a` is an instance of `Ord`. This change ensures that the `<` operator can be used, as it's now guaranteed that the elements of the list can be ordered.
