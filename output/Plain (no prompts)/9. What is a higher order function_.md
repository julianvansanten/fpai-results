What is a higher-order function?


## ChatGPT

A higher-order function is a concept in programming, particularly prominent in functional programming languages. It refers to a function that meets at least one of the following criteria:

1. **Takes one or more functions as arguments**: A higher-order function can accept other functions as parameters. This allows for abstraction over actions, not just values. For instance, functions like `map` or `filter` in many languages take another function as an argument, which defines the criterion for mapping or filtering.

2. **Returns a function as its result**: A higher-order function can also return a function as its output. This allows for the creation of function factories, which can, for example, create new functions on the fly based on certain parameters.

Higher-order functions are a powerful concept because they allow for more modular, reusable, and expressive code. They are a key part of functional programming but are also used in other programming paradigms. They enable techniques like function composition, currying, and decorators, which can lead to more readable and maintainable code.
