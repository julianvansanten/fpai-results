What does (:) do in Haskell?

In Haskell, the `(:)` operator is used to construct lists. It is known as the "cons" operator and is used to prepend an element to the front of a list. Here's a basic explanation:

1. **Prepending Elements**: If you have an element and a list, you can use `(:)` to add the element to the beginning of the list. For example, if `x` is an element and `xs` is a list, `x : xs` results in a new list with `x` as its first element and the elements of `xs` following it.

2. **Pattern Matching**: In addition to constructing lists, `(:)` is also used in pattern matching to decompose lists. In a pattern matching expression, you can use `x : xs` to match a list, binding `x` to the head (first element) of the list and `xs` to the tail (the rest of the list).

3. **Recursive Functions**: It is commonly used in recursive functions that operate on lists. For instance, when defining a function to process a list, you might use pattern matching to separate the head from the tail, process the head, and then recursively call the function on the tail.

Here's a simple example in Haskell:

```haskell
-- Prepending an element to a list
myList = 1 : [2, 3, 4]  -- myList will be [1, 2, 3, 4]

-- Using in a recursive function
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList [] = 0
sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs  -- Sums up the elements of the list
```

In this example, `sumList` uses `(:)` in pattern matching to split the list into head and tail, and then recursively sums up the elements.
