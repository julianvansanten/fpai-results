I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

How can I fix this?

Your Haskell code has a few issues that need to be addressed to work correctly. Let's go through them one by one.

### Issue with `divisers` Function

Firstly, there is an error in your `divisers` function. The condition `m `mod` n == 0` should be `n `mod` m == 0` because you want to find all `m` that divide `n`, not the other way around.

### Issue with `isPrime` Function

The type signature for your `isPrime` function should return a `Bool` (True or False) because it's checking a condition (whether a number is prime or not). So, the type signature should be `Int -> Bool` instead of `Int -> Int`.

### Issue with `primes` Function

The `primes` function should filter the list of integers, not map them. `map` is used when you want to apply a function to each element of a list and return a list of the results. In this case, you want to keep only those elements that satisfy a certain condition (being prime), so you should use `filter` instead of `map`.

### Revised Code

Here's the revised code:

```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], n `mod` m == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Bool
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = filter isPrime
```

This should work as expected, returning a list of prime numbers from a given list of integers.
