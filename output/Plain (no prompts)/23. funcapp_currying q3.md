A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
How can I use the function `f` with `(1, 2)`?

The error you're encountering in Haskell arises because you're attempting to use the function `f` with a single argument `(1, 2)`, which is a tuple. However, the function `f` is defined to take two arguments. In Haskell, functions are curried by default, meaning they take their arguments one at a time. 

To use the function `f` with the values `1` and `2`, you need to apply them as separate arguments, not as a tuple. Here's how you can do it:

```haskell
f 1 2
```

This will correctly apply the function `f` to the arguments `1` and `2`. If you have a tuple `(1, 2)` and want to use its elements as arguments to `f`, you can use pattern matching to extract these values. For example:

```haskell
let (a, b) = (1, 2)
in f a b
```

This will extract `1` and `2` from the tuple `(1, 2)` and apply them to the function `f`.
