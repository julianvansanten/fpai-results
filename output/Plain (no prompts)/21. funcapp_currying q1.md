A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
What does this mean?

The error message you're encountering in Haskell is due to a mismatch between the expected arguments of the function `f` and the way you're calling it. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Function Definition**: Your function `f` is defined as `f x y = x + y`. This means `f` is a function that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum.

2. **Function Call**: You're calling the function with `f (1, 2)`. Here, you're passing a single argument, a tuple `(1, 2)`, to a function that expects two separate arguments.

3. **Error Message**: The error `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer)))` suggests that Haskell is trying to interpret your function call as a function that takes a tuple and returns a tuple, but it can't find a way to display (or "Show") the result because it's not what the function `f` is defined to do.

To fix this error, you should call the function with two separate arguments, like this: `f 1 2`. This matches the definition of your function `f`, which takes two arguments and not a single tuple.
