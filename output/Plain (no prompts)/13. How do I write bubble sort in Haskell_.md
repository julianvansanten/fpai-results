How do I write bubble sort in Haskell?


## ChatGPT

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. In Haskell, a functional programming language, you can implement bubble sort using recursion and pattern matching.

Here's a basic implementation of bubble sort in Haskell:

```haskell
bubbleSort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
bubbleSort [] = []
bubbleSort xs = bubbleSort' xs (length xs)

bubbleSort' :: Ord a => [a] -> Int -> [a]
bubbleSort' xs 0 = xs
bubbleSort' xs n = bubbleSort' (bubble xs) (n - 1)
  where
    bubble [x] = [x]
    bubble (x:y:rest)
      | x > y     = y : bubble (x:rest)
      | otherwise = x : bubble (y:rest)
```

Explanation of the code:

1. `bubbleSort` is the main function that takes a list of orderable elements and sorts it. It uses the helper function `bubbleSort'` to perform the sorting.

2. `bubbleSort'` is a helper function that recursively sorts the list. It accepts the list and the number of elements in the list as arguments. The recursion stops when the second argument (the length of the list) is zero, indicating that no more passes are needed.

3. The `bubble` function inside `bubbleSort'` performs one pass of the bubble sort. It goes through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This function uses pattern matching to handle lists of different lengths.

4. The guard `| x > y` is used to check if two adjacent elements are in the wrong order and need to be swapped.

This implementation is a direct translation of the bubble sort algorithm into Haskell and leverages Haskell's recursion and pattern matching features. However, it's worth noting that bubble sort is not an efficient sorting algorithm for large lists due to its O(nÂ²) time complexity. For more efficient sorting in Haskell, you might consider using built-in functions like `sort` from `Data.List`.
