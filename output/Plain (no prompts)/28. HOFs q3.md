I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

How else can I define `primes`?

The errors you're encountering are related to type mismatches in your Haskell functions. Let's address these issues step by step:

1. **Error in `isPrime` Function**: The type signature of `isPrime` indicates that it should return an `Int`, but the implementation actually returns a `Bool`. This is because the expression `divisers n == [1, n]` is a boolean expression.

2. **Error in `primes` Function**: After fixing `isPrime`, you also need to update `primes`. The `map` function applies a given function to each item of a list, but `isPrime` now returns a `Bool`, and you want to filter the list, not map it.

Here's how you can redefine your functions correctly:

```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], n `mod` m == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Bool
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes xs = filter isPrime xs
```

Explanation:
- **divisers**: The logic was correct, but there was a typo in the list comprehension. It should be `n `mod` m == 0` instead of `m `mod` n == 0`.
- **isPrime**: The type is changed to `Bool` as it checks a condition and returns `True` or `False`.
- **primes**: Now uses `filter` instead of `map`. `filter` will keep only those elements in the list for which `isPrime` returns `True`.

This should fix the type errors and provide the functionality you're looking for.
