Define a higher order merge sort function hoSort in Haskell, in which the relation by which a list should be sorted is given as an argument `r`.

To define a higher-order function `hoSort` in Haskell that performs a merge sort based on a given relation `r`, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the Relation Type**: The relation `r` will be a function that takes two elements of a list and returns a `Bool`. This function determines the order of elements.

2. **Merge Function**: Define a `merge` function that merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list using the relation `r`.

3. **hoSort Function**: Implement the `hoSort` function. This function will split the list into halves, recursively sort each half, and then merge them using the `merge` function.

Here is a possible implementation of `hoSort`:

```haskell
-- Define the type of the relation
type Relation a = a -> a -> Bool

-- Merge two sorted lists based on the relation
merge :: Relation a -> [a] -> [a] -> [a]
merge _ xs [] = xs
merge _ [] ys = ys
merge r (x:xs) (y:ys)
    | r x y     = x : merge r xs (y:ys)
    | otherwise = y : merge r (x:xs) ys

-- The higher order merge sort function
hoSort :: Relation a -> [a] -> [a]
hoSort _ [] = []
hoSort _ [x] = [x]
hoSort r xs = let
    (left, right) = splitAt (length xs `div` 2) xs
    in merge r (hoSort r left) (hoSort r right)
```

In this implementation:

- The `Relation` type is a function that takes two elements of type `a` and returns a `Bool`.

- The `merge` function takes a relation and two lists, then merges these lists according to the relation.

- The `hoSort` function is the main function. It takes a relation and a list, recursively sorts the list based on the relation, and merges the sorted halves.

You can use `hoSort` by providing a relation function. For example, to sort a list of integers in ascending order:

```haskell
hoSort (<) [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
```

This will sort the list `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]` using the less-than relation.
