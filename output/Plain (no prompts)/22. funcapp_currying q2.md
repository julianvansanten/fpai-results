A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
How do I fix this?

In Haskell, the error you're encountering is due to the way you're calling the function `f` with a tuple `(1, 2)` instead of two separate arguments. In Haskell, function application is achieved by spacing, not by enclosing arguments in parentheses as in some other languages.

Your function `f` is defined to take two arguments, `x` and `y`, separately. However, when you call `f (1, 2)`, Haskell interprets `(1, 2)` as a single argument, which is a tuple. Since `f` expects two arguments, not a tuple, you get an error.

To fix this, you should call the function with two separate arguments like this: `f 1 2`.

This will correctly apply the function `f` to the arguments `1` and `2`.
