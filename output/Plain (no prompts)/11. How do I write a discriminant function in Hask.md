How do I write a discriminant function in Haskell?

## ChatGPT

Writing a discriminant function in Haskell involves a few steps. The discriminant, in the context of quadratic equations, is given by the formula \( D = b^2 - 4ac \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are coefficients of the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

Here's how you can define a discriminant function in Haskell:

1. **Define the Function Signature**: In Haskell, it's a good practice to start by defining the type signature of your function. This is not mandatory, but it helps with readability and type checking. For the discriminant function, the signature will indicate that it takes three numbers as input and returns a number as output.

2. **Implement the Function**: Use the formula for the discriminant to implement the function.

Here is an example of how the function can be written:

```haskell
-- Define the type signature
discriminant :: (Num a, Ord a) => a -> a -> a -> a

-- Implement the function
discriminant a b c = b^2 - 4*a*c
```

In this implementation:
- `Num a` means that `a`, `b`, and `c` are numbers.
- `Ord a` is included in case you want to compare the discriminant value (like checking if it's greater than 0).
- `a -> a -> a -> a` indicates that the function takes three arguments of type `a` and returns a value of type `a`.
- `discriminant a b c = b^2 - 4*a*c` is the actual implementation using the discriminant formula.

You can use this function in Haskell by passing three numerical arguments to it. For example, `discriminant 1 2 3` will compute the discriminant for the equation \( x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \).
