A function is given:
```haskell
f x y = x + y
```
When I call the function with `f (1, 2)`, I get the following error: `No instance for (Show ((Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer))) arising from a use of ‘print’ (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)`
Give a function call that works.

The error you're encountering in Haskell is due to the way you're calling the function `f`. Your function `f` is defined to take two arguments, `x` and `y`, but when you call it with `f (1, 2)`, you're actually passing a single argument, which is a tuple `(1, 2)`.

To fix this, you should call the function with two separate arguments, like this:

```haskell
f 1 2
```

This way, you're passing `1` as `x` and `2` as `y`, which matches the function's definition.
