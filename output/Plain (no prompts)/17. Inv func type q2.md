I have to write a function `incr` that checks if each number in a list is greater than its immediate predecessor. I wrote the function given here:
```haskell
incr :: [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```
I get the following error: `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’`.
Why am I not able to use the `<` operator?

The error `No instance for (Ord a) arising from a use of ‘<’` in your Haskell function `incr` occurs because the type signature `incr :: [a] -> Bool` does not specify that the elements of the list must belong to a type that can be ordered. In Haskell, the `<` operator is part of the `Ord` typeclass, which means it can only be used with types that are instances of `Ord`.

To fix this error, you need to restrict the type variable `a` to types that are instances of the `Ord` typeclass. This can be done by modifying the type signature of your function:

```haskell
incr :: (Ord a) => [a] -> Bool
incr [] = True
incr [x] = True
incr (x:y:xs) = x < y && incr (y:xs)
```

In this revised type signature, `(Ord a) =>` indicates that `a` must be a type for which ordering operations (like `<`) are defined. This change will allow your function to compile and work as intended, provided the list elements are of a type that can be compared with each other (like `Int`, `Float`, `Char`, etc.).
