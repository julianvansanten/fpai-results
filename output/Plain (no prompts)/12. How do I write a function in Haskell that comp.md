How do I write a function in Haskell that computes the dividers of a given number?


## ChatGPT

To write a function in Haskell that computes the dividers (or factors) of a given number, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Define the Function Signature**: Specify the type of the function. For this function, it will take an integer and return a list of integers.

2. **Implement the Logic**: The function will iterate over a range of numbers (usually from 1 to the given number) and check if each number is a divider. A number is a divider if the given number divided by it leaves no remainder.

3. **Return the Result**: Collect and return all the numbers that are dividers of the given number.

Here's a basic example of how this function might look in Haskell:

```haskell
dividers :: Int -> [Int]
dividers n = [x | x <- [1..n], n `mod` x == 0]
```

In this function:

- `dividers :: Int -> [Int]` is the function signature. It takes an `Int` and returns a list of `Int`.
- `[x | x <- [1..n], n \`mod\` x == 0]` is a list comprehension. It generates a list of numbers `x` such that `x` is in the range from 1 to `n` and `n` divided by `x` has a remainder of 0 (meaning `x` is a divider of `n`).

You can use this function by passing an integer to it, like `dividers 10`, which would return `[1,2,5,10]` as these are the dividers of 10.
