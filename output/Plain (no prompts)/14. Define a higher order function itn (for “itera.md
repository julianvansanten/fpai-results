Define a higher order function `itn` (for “iterate `n` times”) with three arguments `f`, `a`, `n` in Haskell.


## ChatGPT

In Haskell, a higher order function is a function that takes other functions as arguments or returns a function as a result. The `itn` function you're asking for is a higher order function that applies another function `f` to an initial value `a`, `n` times. Here is how you can define `itn`:

```haskell
itn :: (a -> a) -> a -> Int -> a
itn f a n
    | n <= 0    = a
    | otherwise = itn f (f a) (n - 1)
```

Let's break down this function:

1. The type signature `itn :: (a -> a) -> a -> Int -> a` tells us that `itn` takes three arguments:
   - A function `f` of type `(a -> a)`, which means it is a function that takes an argument of type `a` and returns a value of type `a`.
   - An initial value `a` of type `a`.
   - An integer `n` of type `Int`.

2. The function body uses pattern matching and recursion:
   - The guard `| n <= 0 = a` serves as the base case for the recursion. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns the current value of `a`.
   - The recursive case `| otherwise = itn f (f a) (n - 1)` applies the function `f` to `a`, then recursively calls `itn` with the new value and `n - 1`.

This function will repeatedly apply `f` to its result, starting with `a`, `n` times. If `n` is 0 or negative, it will return `a` without any modification.
