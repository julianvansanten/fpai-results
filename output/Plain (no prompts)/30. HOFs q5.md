I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

Generate a function `primes` which gives all prime numbers out of a given list.

It looks like you have a couple of issues in your Haskell code related to type mismatches and logical errors. Let's address them step by step.

1. **The `divisers` function**: This function is intended to find all divisors of a number `n`. However, the condition `m `mod` n == 0` is incorrect because it checks whether `m` is a divisor of `n`, which is not what you want. Instead, you should use `n `mod` m == 0`.

2. **The `isPrime` function**: The type signature of `isPrime` should be `Int -> Bool` since it's supposed to return a Boolean indicating whether the number is prime or not. Moreover, the logic inside the function is correct, but it needs to return a `Bool`.

3. **The `primes` function**: This function is supposed to filter a list of integers, keeping only the prime numbers. The `map` function is not suitable for this purpose because `map` transforms each element of the list but does not filter them. You need to use `filter` instead.

Let's correct your code with these adjustments:

```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], n `mod` m == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Bool
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes lst = filter isPrime lst
```

This corrected version should work as expected:

- `divisers` finds all divisors of a given number.
- `isPrime` checks if the only divisors are 1 and the number itself, which is the definition of a prime number.
- `primes` filters a list of integers, retaining only those that are prime.
