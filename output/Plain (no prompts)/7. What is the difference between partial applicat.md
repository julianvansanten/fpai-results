What is the difference between partial application and currying?


## ChatGPT

Partial application and currying are two concepts in functional programming that are often confused, but they have distinct differences:

1. **Partial Application**:
   - **Definition**: Partial application refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity. Essentially, it's about creating a new function by pre-filling some of the arguments to the original function.
   - **Example**: Consider a function `f(a, b, c)`. If you partially apply the first argument (let's say with `a = 1`), you get a new function `g(b, c)` which is `f(1, b, c)`.
   - **Usage**: It's useful for creating simpler functions from complex ones by baking in some data and leaving the rest to be specified later.

2. **Currying**:
   - **Definition**: Currying is the transformation of a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. Curried functions return a new function that expects the next argument inline.
   - **Example**: Again, with a function `f(a, b, c)`, when it's curried, it turns into `f(a)(b)(c)`. Each invocation returns a new function that consumes the next argument.
   - **Usage**: Currying is helpful in a functional programming setting where functions are first-class citizens. It allows for creating highly modular and reusable functions.

In summary, partial application is about creating functions by fixing some number of arguments, and it doesn't change the structure of the function itself. Currying, on the other hand, transforms a function with multiple arguments into a chain of functions, each taking a single argument.
