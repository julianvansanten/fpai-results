Why is `[1,2,3]` the same as `1 : 2 : 3 : []` in Haskell?

In Haskell, the expression `[1,2,3]` is equivalent to `1 : 2 : 3 : []` because of the way lists are constructed in Haskell. Let's break down the latter expression to understand this equivalence:

1. **List Construction with `:`**: In Haskell, the `:` operator is used to construct lists. It takes an element on its left and a list on its right and produces a new list with the element prepended to the given list. For instance, `1 : [2,3]` would result in the list `[1,2,3]`.

2. **The Empty List `[]`**: The `[]` represents an empty list in Haskell. It's the base case for list construction.

3. **Building the List**: When you see `1 : 2 : 3 : []`, it's a shorthand way of constructing the list. Starting from the right:
   - `[]` is an empty list.
   - `3 : []` is constructing a list with `3` at the front, resulting in `[3]`.
   - `2 : [3]` then puts `2` at the front of `[3]`, resulting in `[2,3]`.
   - Finally, `1 : [2,3]` puts `1` at the front, resulting in `[1,2,3]`.

Therefore, `1 : 2 : 3 : []` is just a step-by-step construction of the list `[1,2,3]`, and the two expressions are equivalent in Haskell. This syntactic feature allows for a very concise and functional way of defining lists, which is a fundamental aspect of Haskell's design as a functional programming language.
