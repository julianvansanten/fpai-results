Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is based on a few key concepts from mathematics, particularly lambda calculus and category theory.

1. **Lambda Calculus**: Lambda calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables. The syntax of lambda calculus is minimal, consisting only of:
   - **Function abstraction**: It represents the definition of an anonymous function, often written as λx.M, where x is the argument, and M is the expression.
   - **Function application**: It represents the process of applying a function to an argument, usually written as (M N), where M is the function and N is the argument.

2. **Immutability**: In functional programming, data is immutable. Once a data structure is created, it cannot be changed. If you want a similar, but modified data structure, you create a new one. This concept is closely related to mathematical functions, which produce the same output for the same input always.

3. **Pure Functions**: A pure function is a function where the return value is only determined by its input values, without observable side effects. This is akin to a mathematical function, which provides a consistent output for a given input.

4. **Recursion**: Recursion is a fundamental concept in both mathematics and functional programming. Since functional programming languages don’t use iteration constructs like loops, recursion is used instead to repeatedly apply a function.

5. **Higher-Order Functions**: These are functions that take other functions as inputs or return them as outputs. This is similar to higher-order operations in mathematics, where functions operate on other functions (like functional composition or derivatives in calculus).

6. **Type Systems**: Many functional programming languages use strong, static type systems, akin to formal systems in mathematics. These type systems can enforce certain properties of the code at compile time, which can prevent runtime errors and bugs.

7. **Category Theory**: While more abstract, concepts from category theory have influenced functional programming. Category theory deals with abstract structures and relationships between them. In functional programming, this relates to the composition of functions and the mapping of data types.

In summary, functional programming is deeply rooted in mathematical concepts, particularly those that treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, emphasizing immutability, purity, and higher-order functions.
