I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

Rewrite the given code such that it works.

To fix the code, we need to address a couple of issues:

1. The type signature of `isPrime` should be `Int -> Bool` instead of `Int -> Int`, as it returns a Boolean value indicating whether a number is prime or not.
2. The implementation of `divisers` function is incorrect. It should check if `n` is divisible by `m` (i.e., `n `mod` m == 0`), not the other way around.
3. The `primes` function should filter the input list based on whether the elements are prime, instead of mapping. The `map` function transforms each element of the list, but here we need to filter elements, so we should use `filter`.

Here's the corrected code:

```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], n `mod` m == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Bool
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = filter isPrime
```

With these corrections, the code should work as expected in GHCi. The `divisers` function now correctly finds all divisors of `n`, `isPrime` checks if the only divisors are 1 and `n` itself (indicating a prime number), and `primes` filters the input list to retain only the prime numbers.
