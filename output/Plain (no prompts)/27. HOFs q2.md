I want to define a `primes` function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list. I have defined the following functions:
```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], m `mod` n == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Int
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = map (isPrime)
```

When I load the file `Main.hs` into GHCi, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
In the expression: divisers n == [1, n]
      In an equation for ‘isPrime’: isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]
```

But when I change the type of `isPrime`, I get the following error:

```plaintext
Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int’
      Expected: Int -> Int
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(isPrime)’
      In the expression: map (isPrime)
      In an equation for ‘mysum’: mysum = map (isPrime)
```

Why should the type of isPrime be `Int -> Bool`? I want to make `primes :: [Int] -> [Int]`, but if I make `isPrime :: Int -> Bool`, the type will become `[Int] -> [Bool]`.

Your Haskell code and the errors you're encountering highlight a common misunderstanding about type signatures and function composition in Haskell. Let's break it down to clarify the issues and correct your code.

1. **The `isPrime` Function:**
   - **Original Issue**: The type signature of `isPrime` in your code is `Int -> Int`, but the actual implementation returns a boolean value (`divisers n == [1, n]`). This inconsistency is what's causing the first error.
   - **Correct Type Signature**: The function `isPrime` should have the type `Int -> Bool` because it checks whether a number is prime or not and returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`).

2. **The `primes` Function:**
   - **Original Misunderstanding**: You're concerned that changing `isPrime` to return `Bool` will make `primes` return `[Bool]`, but that's not the case. The function `primes` should filter the list of integers, not map them.
   - **Correct Implementation**: Instead of using `map`, you should use `filter` with `isPrime`. The `filter` function applies a predicate (`isPrime` in your case) to a list and returns a list of elements for which the predicate is `True`. This will give you a list of prime numbers.

Here's the corrected code:

```haskell
divisers :: Int -> [Int]
divisers n = [ m | m <- [1..n], n `mod` m == 0 ]

isPrime :: Int -> Bool
isPrime n = divisers n == [1, n]

primes :: [Int] -> [Int]
primes = filter isPrime
```

Note:
- In `divisers`, it should be `n \`mod\` m == 0`, not `m \`mod\` n == 0`.
- The `primes` function is now correctly using `filter isPrime`, which will return a list of integers that are prime.
